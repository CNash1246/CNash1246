# Christopher Nash

Hello! I'm Christopher Nash, a Computer Science student at UNCC with a passion for learning and creating. I'm exploring various fields, from game design to web development, and my primary focus is on continuous growth and producing projects that I can be proud of. I have a few projects that showcase my skills and learning journey so far, and I'm always eager to add more. I'm looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals who are interested in growing, learning, and sharing ideas together. Let's connect and create something amazing!
